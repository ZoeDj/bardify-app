This is a page that mixes modern lyricism with old.  We take input from the user in the form of an artist and song, and run it through an api that generates the lyrics the the given song. After, we run that return through another api that will translate the lyrics to Shakespearean English, and then display them to the user. For added entertainment, and a bit of a hook, we run the translated lyrics through another api that preforms text to speech-- in hopes to give you a funny sounding version of the song you chose.
